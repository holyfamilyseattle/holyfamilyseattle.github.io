Consider the story of a man who approached his pastor, frustrated with the church. He had witnessed hypocrisy, gossip, and distractions among the congregation and was ready to leave. Before he made his decision, the pastor gave him a simple task: “Take this glass full of water and walk around the church three times without spilling a drop.” The man carefully followed the instruction, keeping his full attention on the glass to ensure not a single drop was lost. When he returned, the pastor asked, “Did you notice anyone gossiping? Did you see any hypocrites?” The man replied, “No, I was too focused on my glass of water.” Smiling, the pastor said, “When you come to church, focus on Jesus, not on people. People may fail, but Christ never will. Build your faith on Him, not on the actions of others.”"><meta property="og:locale" content="en_us"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2025-03-11T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-03-11T00:00:00+00:00"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Priest's Corner"><meta name=twitter:description content="Second Sunday of the Season of Lent (Mt. 7:21-27) Today’s Gospel reading highlights two essential themes: Heaven belongs to those who do the will of God, and we must remain focused on Christ.

The stronger our faith, the more steadfast our lives will be. A foundation built on Christ will not crumble in the storms of life, and those who stand firm in faith will inherit Heaven. Coming to church is important, but it is not enough. True faith is not just about hearing God’s Word—it is about living it every day. The question for reflection is this: Are we building our lives on Jesus, our solid rock?</p><hr><div id=meta></div></div></section><footer id=footer><ul class=icons><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/SeattleSyroMalabar target=_blank aria-label=Facebook><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"><span class=label>Facebook</span></i></a></li></ul><ul class=copyright><li><a href=//creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>CC0 (public domain)</a></li><li>Design: <a href=//html5up.net/alpha>HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Developed by <a href=//github.com/ajithjose>Ajith Cherukad Jose</a></li></ul></footer></div><script src=/js/jquery.min.ff1523fb7389539c84c65aba19260648793bb4f5e29329d2ee8804bc37a3fe6e.js integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/jquery.dropotron.min.4b0a4c1a278f32f74c140865e40671b5225fcb317ccde6a7ac568b7c1c1acbe0.js integrity="sha256-SwpMGiePMvdMFAhl5AZxtSJfyzF8zeanrFaLfBway+A=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/jquery.scrollex.min.fc25b75fb3fc8b42756413be387e0d7a602813125283d2384551961d73ea784e.js integrity="sha256-/CW3X7P8i0J1ZBO+OH4NemAoExJSg9I4RVGWHXPqeE4=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/browser.min.87910d5ed0053d90caf83230a2f1811d8679815da01f7bdec7548e776d7f04c4.js integrity="sha256-h5ENXtAFPZDK+DIwovGBHYZ5gV2gH3vex1SOd21/BMQ=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/breakpoints.min.309febcd6d6e0cf092201532215f03a6a9f30b30f26203272a4861d704e7cd52.js integrity="sha256-MJ/rzW1uDPCSIBUyIV8DpqnzCzDyYgMnKkhh1wTnzVI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/util.min.eac24742c66d70530ac02c941fb90b4c7c49aa4465cc3073d28917930634b2d3.js integrity="sha256-6sJHQsZtcFMKwCyUH7kLTHxJqkRlzDBz0okXkwY0stM=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/main.min.de1c5b8b6ae2325b2bbee12ec35c6ff34ebcaaee7a9ad29f69bd8f8c6f8a4f93.js integrity="sha256-3hxbi2riMlsrvuEuw1xv8068qu56mtKfab2PjG+KT5M=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script>var refTagger={settings:{bibleVersion:"CSB",roundCorners:!0,socialSharing:[]}};(function(e,t){var n=e.createElement(t),s=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];n.src="//api.reftagger.com/v2/RefTagger.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(n,s)})(document,"script")</script><!--[if lte IE 8]><script src="{{ $ie.RelPermalink }}"></script><![endif]--><script src=https://cdn.plyr.io/3.6.9/plyr.polyfilled.js crossorigin=anonymous></script><script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#player").length&&new Plyr("#player",{settings:["speed"]})})</script><script src=https://instant.page/5.1.0 type=module defer integrity=sha384-by67kQnR+pyfy8yWP4kPO12fHKRLHZPfEsiSXR8u2IKcTdxD805MGUXBzVPnkLHw crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
