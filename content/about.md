Holy Family Syro Malabar Catholic Mission, is made up of vibrant, faithful people who serve our Mission and community in numerous ways â€“ from worship, religious education and formation, sacramental preparation and spiritual development, to community outreach and social activities. We strive to be a welcoming community that reflects the heart, mercy and teachings of Christ, under the obedience of the Roman Catholic Church through the tradition of the Syro Malabar Rite. We pray you find, Holy Family Syro Malabar Catholic Mission to be a warm and welcoming place where you can deepen your faith by being a part of our Mission.

The Syro-Malabar church is one of the 22 Oriental Catholic Churches. The Major Archiepiscopal Church is in full communion with the Catholic Church. The community is headed by Major Archbishop of Ernakulam-Angamaly, His Grace Mar George Alencherry. The members of the Church are also known as Mar Thoma Nasranis or Syrian Catholics. We trace our origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.

On October 15, 2020, His Excellency Mar Jacob Angadiath, the head of  Syro Malabar diocese of Chicago, appointed Rev. Fr. Mathews Munjanath as Mission Director. He served until May 2022. Starting May 2022, Fr. James Joseph is appointed as the Priest In Charge of the community.
