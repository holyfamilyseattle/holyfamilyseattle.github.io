The Syro-Malabar church is one of the 22 Oriental Catholic Churches. The Major Archiepiscopal Church is in full communion with the Catholic Church. The community is headed by Major Archbishop of Ernakulam-Angamaly, His Grace Mar George Alencherry. The members of the Church are also known as Mar Thoma Nasranis or Syrian Catholics. We trace our origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.

On October 15, 2020, His Excellency Mar Jacob Angadiath, the head of  Syro Malabar diocese of Chicago, appointed Rev. Fr. Mathews Munjanath as Mission Director. He served until May 2022. Starting May 2022, Fr. James Joseph is appointed as Mission Director and Pastor of the community.
