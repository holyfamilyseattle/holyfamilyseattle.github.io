### **Theme of the Year 2024 - 2025**


**Background:**

We introduced the “Theme of the Year” during the academic year 2023-24 to bring the student body, teachers and the parents together and focus on a common faith-based concept. Different grades/classes of the CCD program are at different stages of their faith formation journey. With the theme of the year, we have all classes work on the same concept. The theme is not an alternative to the CCD curriculum; the theme only acts as a complement to the curriculum and aims to enhance and strengthen the faith formation experience for students, teachers and parents.

**Focus on Eucharistic Revival:**

The National Eucharistic Revival is a three-year initiative, launched in June 2022 and sponsored by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). It aims “to inspire and prepare the People of God to be formed, healed, converted, united, and sent out to a hurting and hungry world through a renewed encounter with Jesus in the Eucharist”. The St. Thomas Syro-Malabar Eparchy of Chicago has joined this movement with the mission “to renew the Church by enkindling a living relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist”. 
We must join this initiative and promote Eucharistic Revival in our little mission as well, not only to show solidarity to the eparchy’s commitment but also to help our mission benefit from this nationwide catholic movement. We believe that the CCD’s Theme of the Year is a powerful vehicle to impart this message in every child enrolled in the CCD program, who will then carry it to every family in the mission. 
Therefore, our CCD Theme of the Year for academic year 2024-25 will be 
### Emmanuel, God is with us!
### ദൈവം നമ്മോടു കൂടെ!

---

**Implementation:**

The movement is in its second year, i.e., Year of Parish Revival, which concludes with the National Eucharistic Congress in July 2024. While we are a little late in joining this initiative, we have the benefit of learning from the various activities in different parishes of the eparchy. Some of the events we will be conducting next year include (and not limited to):

* Principal’s Challenge
* Annual camp focused on theme
* Theme-based content in newsletter
* CCD video for Christmas/Easter focussed on theme
* Kids retreat focused on the theme - this will depend on the overall mission’s focus during lenten retreat
* Kalolsavam events focused on theme
* Exhibition of Eucharistic Miracles by middle and high schoolers
* Eucharistic adoration led by CCD students and teachers, twice a year
* Class/Grade specific events organized by class teachers
* Additionally, to continue to reinforce the theme from the previous year, we will request teachers to continue to encourage children to say Eesho Mishihaykku Sthuthi Aayirikkatte before/after class.

**Conclusion:**

As with every other initiative, this requires everyone to come together - students, teachers, parents and the whole community - with new ideas that promote the theme of the year. As irrational as it may sound, we are not working towards a particular goal nor do we have a “definition for success”. We will do His work, guided by His Spirit and enjoy the gifts and fruits that He reaps for us. And whatever we do, we will do everything for the glory of God!

**Act of Spiritual Communion (Grades 5 and up)**

My Jesus, 

I believe that You are present in the Most Holy Sacrament. 

I love You above all things, 
and I desire to receive You into my soul. 

Since I cannot at this moment receive You sacramentally, 
come at least spiritually into my heart. 

I embrace You as if You were already there 
and unite myself wholly to You. 

Never permit me to be separated from You.

Amen.
