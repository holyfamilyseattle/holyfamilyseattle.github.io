#### ഈശോ മിശിഹായ്ക്ക് സ്തുതി ആയിരിക്കട്ടെ

*So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.* (1 Cor 10:31)

Growing up, we were taught to say *Eesho mishihaykku sthuthi aayirikkatte*, to our parents, our elders, fathers and sisters - not just as a sign of respect but also to give praise to the Lord. It is that virtue that we intend to teach and practice with the children this year. Throughout the year we will have several activities during class and outside class that will help the children build the virtue of giving praise, giving glory to God in all that they do. Our goal is to have every child in the mission comfortable to say *Sthuthi* by the end of the academic year.
