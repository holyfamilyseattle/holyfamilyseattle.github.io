#### ഈശോ മിശിഹായ്ക്ക് സ്തുതി ആയിരിക്കട്ടെ

*So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.* (1 Cor 10:31)


Growing up, we were taught to say *EEsho mishihaykku sthuthi aayirikkatte*, to our parents, our elders, fathers and sisters - not just as a sign of respect but also to give praise to the Lord. It is that virtue that we intend to teach and practice with the children this year. Throughout the year we will have several activities during class and outside class that will help the children build the virtue of giving praise, giving glory to God in all that they do. Our goal is to have every child in the mission comfortable to say *Sthuthi* by the end of the academic year.

#### Principal’s Challenge

Dear Children,

In your handbook, you will find nine verses from the Bible that are related to our theme of the year. You can win this award simply by learning these verses by heart and reciting those to your CCD teachers or your Vice Principals (Sajay uncle or Tom uncle) or me in-person before the end of the academic year. Just ask your parents to tell us when you are ready!
 
* Everyone who can do this will be a winner
* First 10 children to do this will win a special prize
* Students who complete the challenge will be featured on this website
* **Big Twist** - even after reciting this once, don’t rest easy! We will check with you again, any time of the year to make sure you have really learnt it.
