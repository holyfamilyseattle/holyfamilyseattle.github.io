### Second Sunday of the Season of Lent (Mt. 7:21-27)

Today’s Gospel reading (Matthew 7:21-27) highlights two essential themes: 

**Heaven belongs to those who do the will of God, and we must remain focused on Christ**

Consider the story of a man who approached his pastor, frustrated with the church. He had witnessed hypocrisy, gossip, and distractions among the congregation and was ready to leave. Before he made his decision, the pastor gave him a simple task: "Take this glass full of water and walk around the church three times without spilling a drop." The man carefully followed the instruction, keeping his full attention on the glass to ensure not a single drop was lost. When he returned, the pastor asked, "Did you notice anyone gossiping? Did you see any hypocrites?" The man replied, "No, I was too focused on my glass of water." Smiling, the pastor said, "When you come to church, focus on Jesus, not on people. People may fail, but Christ never will. Build your faith on Him, not on the actions of others."

It is not mere words spoken in church that matter, but the actions that arise from genuine faith. The stronger our faith, the more steadfast our lives will be. A foundation built on Christ will not crumble in the storms of life, and those who stand firm in faith will inherit Heaven. Coming to church is important, but it is not enough. True faith is not just about hearing God’s Word—it is about living it every day. The question for reflection is this: Are we building our lives on Jesus, our solid rock?

### First Sunday of the Season of Lent (Mt. 4:1-11)

**Reflections on Jesus' Temptations and Our Lenten Journey**

We begin the season of Lent by reflecting on the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11). These three temptations correspond to fundamental aspects of human life: body, mind, and spirit.

1. **The Temptation of Bread** – This represents the bodily aspect of our lives. Our physical needs are essential for survival, but this temptation challenges us to ask: Are we focused solely on our bodily needs?

2. **The Temptation to Throw Himself Down from the Temple** – This relates to the mind. We seek validation, influence, authority, and popularity, but the question is: Are we too controlled by these desires?

3. **The Temptation of Worship** – This speaks to the spiritual aspect of life. Satan tempts Jesus to replace God with something else. We must ask ourselves: Are we replacing God with worldly distractions?

Reflecting on these aspects helps us structure our Lenten preparation with three key goals: cleansing, strengthening, and fostering relationships.

- **Cleansing**

Purify the body through fasting and abstaining from unhealthy or excessive food.
Purify the mind by avoiding harmful distractions and habits that cloud our thoughts.
Purify the spirit by identifying and removing anything that has replaced God in our lives.

- **Strengthening**

Build a healthier body by adopting better eating habits and self-discipline.
Strengthen the mind by cultivating positive thoughts and wisdom.
Deepen the spirit through prayer, reflection, and spiritual nourishment.

- **Fostering Relationships**

Restore broken relationships with our brothers and sisters.
Reconnect with God through personal and communal prayer.
Build new, meaningful relationships rooted in love and faith.

**Practical Lenten Commitments**
- Abstain from foods and drinks that are harmful or addictive; adopt healthy eating habits.
- Eliminate distractions and addictive behaviors that cloud the mind.
- Dedicate more time to personal and communal prayer.
- Reconcile with those we have wronged and nurture relationships with love.
- Engage in charitable acts, such as volunteering or supporting those in need.
- By focusing on these aspects, our Lenten journey becomes a time of renewal, drawing us closer to God and preparing us for the joy of Easter.
