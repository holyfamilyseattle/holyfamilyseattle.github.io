### Fifth Sunday of the Season of Lent (Mt. 21:33-44)

**Jesus, the Source of Living Water and the Light of the World**

Today’s Gospel readings present us with two profound images of Jesus: the Living Water and the Light of the World. These are not mere metaphors but divine realities that reveal Christ’s mission and His invitation to each of us.
The context of today’s Gospel is the Feast of Tabernacles, a sacred celebration in which the Jewish people commemorated God’s providence during their forty years of wandering in the wilderness. They recalled how He sustained them with water from the rock and guided them with a pillar of fire. Against this rich backdrop, Jesus makes two extraordinary declarations, offering Himself as the fulfillment of these divine provisions.
Jesus, the Source of Living Water (John 7:37-39)

On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stands in the temple and proclaims: "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them." (John. 7:37-38). Here, Jesus speaks of the Holy Spirit, the divine gift that would be poured out upon all who believe in Him. Just as water is essential for physical life, the Spirit is essential for our spiritual vitality, refreshing, renewing, and empowering our souls.
Every human heart experiences spiritual thirst, a longing for peace, meaning, and true joy. Yet, many attempt to quench this thirst with the fleeting satisfactions of wealth, power, and pleasure. These may momentarily gratify, but they leave the soul restless and unfulfilled. Only Jesus, the true Living Water, can satisfy the deepest desires of our hearts, filling us with the grace and strength to live as children of God.
Jesus, the Light of the World (John 8:12-20)

In the following passage, Jesus makes another bold proclamation: "I am the Light of the World. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life." (John. 8:12) This declaration takes on even greater significance when we consider that, during the Feast of Tabernacles, lamps were lit in the temple to recall how God led His people through the wilderness with a pillar of fire. By claiming to be the Light of the World, Jesus is not merely offering guidance, He is revealing that He Himself is the divine presence of God, dispelling the darkness of sin, ignorance, and despair. Darkness represents all that separates us from God, confusion, doubt, and the burden of sin. In today’s world, we witness many walking in such darkness, losing hope, struggling with addiction, weighed down by anger or sorrow. Yet, Jesus assures us that whoever follows Him will never walk in darkness, for His light leads to truth, freedom, and eternal life.
Becoming Bearers of Light and Living Water
Water and light are essential to life. Without water, we wither; without light, we are lost. In the same way, those around us who are deprived of love, kindness, or hope experience a kind of spiritual drought and darkness. As followers of Christ, we are called not only to receive His light and living water but to become bearers of these gifts to others. When we extend compassion to the suffering, we quench their thirst. When we offer kindness and truth, we bring light to their path. In doing so, we become instruments of Christ’s grace, making a profound difference in the lives of those we encounter.

### Fourth Sunday of the Season of Lent (Mt. 21:33-44)

**The Parable of the Wicked Tenants**

Today's Gospel (Matthew 21:33-44) presents the profound parable of the wicked tenants, a story that unveils the stark reality of human attitudes and their inevitable consequences. At its heart lies the tragedy of rejection, an outright refusal to acknowledge the landowner, his messengers, and ultimately, his beloved son. This rejection, however, was not a mere misunderstanding, but the fruit of a deeply rooted negative disposition, one born of selfishness and pride.

The tenants, blinded by their own arrogance, could not bring themselves to recognize the rightful ownership of the landowner. Their hearts, hardened by greed, sought to claim unjustly what was never theirs to possess. Indeed, in every negative attitude, pride and selfishness stand as twin pillars, distorting one's vision and leading to destructive choices. When consumed by such emotions, one not only harms oneself but also wounds others, setting in motion a chain of ruinous consequences.

On this blessed feast of St. Joseph, we are presented with a striking contrast, a man of unwavering virtue, who, in the face of uncertainty, embraced life with a heart full of faith and a spirit adorned with humility. Where others may have faltered in doubt or resentment, St. Joseph chose a path illumined by trust in divine providence. His was a soul untarnished by selfish ambition, a heart that saw beyond mere appearances and recognized the hand of God in every unfolding event.

Had he been ruled by pride, he might have questioned, doubted, or even turned away. Yet, instead of succumbing to bitterness, he moved forward with serene surrender, choosing to believe rather than to rebel, to trust rather than to despair. His silent strength and steadfast faith won him the singular honor of being the earthly guardian of the Holy Family, a role of unparalleled grace and responsibility.

May we, like St. Joseph, cultivate a spirit of humble obedience and unwavering trust, dispelling every trace of selfishness and pride. Let our hearts remain open to the divine Will, that we may never fall into the tragedy of rejection but instead flourish in the vineyard of God’s boundless love.

### Third Sunday of the Season of Lent (Mt. 7:21-27)

**Building Our Lives Anchored on the Rock of Christ**

Today’s Gospel passage highlights a profound truth about our faith journey. The essential question we must ask ourselves is: Where is my anchor? Is my life truly rooted in Christ, the unwavering Rock?

The disciples of Jesus, though privileged to walk alongside the Master, were not fixated on His divine presence. Instead, their minds were preoccupied with thoughts of status and the positions they would hold in His kingdom. What a striking contrast! While Jesus remained steadfast in His mission, to fulfill the will of His Father, while his disciples were entangled in the fleeting attractions of this world!

The parable of the wise builder serves as a timeless lesson. The one who listens to the Word of God and allows it to shape his life is like a man who builds his house upon solid rock. When storms arise, when trials, temptations, and hardships threaten, his foundation holds firm, for it is deeply rooted in faith. Conversely, the foolish builder is one who hears the Word but fails to live by it. His life is like a house built on shifting sands, fragile, vulnerable, and easily swept away when adversity strikes.

This parable reminds us that the foundation upon which we build our lives matters immensely. Are we securing our lives on Christ, the eternal cornerstone, or are we constructing them upon the fleeting sands of wealth, power, and worldly success?

Moreover, our faith must not be passive; it calls for action. Christ invites us to a life of authentic discipleship, where His teachings are not mere words but a lived reality. Love, forgiveness, humility, and service must be the hallmarks of our existence. When our lives are anchored in Him, no storm can shake the foundation upon which we stand. Let us, then, build wisely; upon the Jesus the rock that never fails.

### Second Sunday of the Season of Lent (Mt. 7:21-27)

Today’s Gospel reading (Matthew 7:21-27) highlights two essential themes: 

**Heaven belongs to those who do the will of God, and we must remain focused on Christ**

Consider the story of a man who approached his pastor, frustrated with the church. He had witnessed hypocrisy, gossip, and distractions among the congregation and was ready to leave. Before he made his decision, the pastor gave him a simple task: "Take this glass full of water and walk around the church three times without spilling a drop." The man carefully followed the instruction, keeping his full attention on the glass to ensure not a single drop was lost. When he returned, the pastor asked, "Did you notice anyone gossiping? Did you see any hypocrites?" The man replied, "No, I was too focused on my glass of water." Smiling, the pastor said, "When you come to church, focus on Jesus, not on people. People may fail, but Christ never will. Build your faith on Him, not on the actions of others."

It is not mere words spoken in church that matter, but the actions that arise from genuine faith. The stronger our faith, the more steadfast our lives will be. A foundation built on Christ will not crumble in the storms of life, and those who stand firm in faith will inherit Heaven. Coming to church is important, but it is not enough. True faith is not just about hearing God’s Word—it is about living it every day. The question for reflection is this: Are we building our lives on Jesus, our solid rock?

### First Sunday of the Season of Lent (Mt. 4:1-11)

**Reflections on Jesus' Temptations and Our Lenten Journey**

We begin the season of Lent by reflecting on the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11). These three temptations correspond to fundamental aspects of human life: body, mind, and spirit.

1. **The Temptation of Bread** – This represents the bodily aspect of our lives. Our physical needs are essential for survival, but this temptation challenges us to ask: Are we focused solely on our bodily needs?

2. **The Temptation to Throw Himself Down from the Temple** – This relates to the mind. We seek validation, influence, authority, and popularity, but the question is: Are we too controlled by these desires?

3. **The Temptation of Worship** – This speaks to the spiritual aspect of life. Satan tempts Jesus to replace God with something else. We must ask ourselves: Are we replacing God with worldly distractions?

Reflecting on these aspects helps us structure our Lenten preparation with three key goals: cleansing, strengthening, and fostering relationships.

- **Cleansing**

Purify the body through fasting and abstaining from unhealthy or excessive food.
Purify the mind by avoiding harmful distractions and habits that cloud our thoughts.
Purify the spirit by identifying and removing anything that has replaced God in our lives.

- **Strengthening**

Build a healthier body by adopting better eating habits and self-discipline.
Strengthen the mind by cultivating positive thoughts and wisdom.
Deepen the spirit through prayer, reflection, and spiritual nourishment.

- **Fostering Relationships**

Restore broken relationships with our brothers and sisters.
Reconnect with God through personal and communal prayer.
Build new, meaningful relationships rooted in love and faith.

**Practical Lenten Commitments**
- Abstain from foods and drinks that are harmful or addictive; adopt healthy eating habits.
- Eliminate distractions and addictive behaviors that cloud the mind.
- Dedicate more time to personal and communal prayer.
- Reconcile with those we have wronged and nurture relationships with love.
- Engage in charitable acts, such as volunteering or supporting those in need.
- By focusing on these aspects, our Lenten journey becomes a time of renewal, drawing us closer to God and preparing us for the joy of Easter.
