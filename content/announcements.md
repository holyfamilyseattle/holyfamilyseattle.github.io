1. On Saturday, May 6th at 10:30 AM, our mission celebrated the First Holy Communion and Confirmation at Holy Innocents Catholic Church in Duvall. The ceremony was presided over by His Excellency Bishop Mar Jacob Angadiath, with Fr. James Joseph SDB as the co-celebrant. It was a privilege for us to witness 12 children receiving their First Holy Communion and 6 children receiving the Sacrament of Confirmation. After the Holy Mass, we held a reception in the parish hall. We are excited to share the photographs of the ceremony with you soon.
