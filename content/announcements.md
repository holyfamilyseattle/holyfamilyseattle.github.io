1. LFML meeting in February has been moved to Sunday, February 12th after mass in the sanctuary.

2. Sunday School is partnering with the outreach ministry to gather food and non-food items for donation to Tent City 4, a homeless encampment in Sammamish. We invite you to contribute individually or as a small group or class, preparing a hot dinner for the residents. For more information on how to prepare and drop off the dinner, please contact Anna Mathew (503-200-8516) or Betty Chempananical(347-679-9537). Non-food items can be dropped off between January 22nd and February 19th at the following locations:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bothell: 19220 25th Dr SE, Bothell, WA 98012 <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issaquah: 24520 SE 45th St, Sammamish, WA 98029 <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellevue: 16450 SE 24th St, Bellevue, WA 98008 <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptable non-perishable items include blankets, AA, AAA, and D batteries, flashlights, hand warmers, coffee, tea, cream, sugar, and canned & packaged food. Sunday school students, when you drop off items, please write your grade with a marker on the item (example: 1A, 3B, etc.). Grade 10 students will track which class collects the most items and have planned a surprise for that class. All other donations do not need to be marked. We greatly appreciate your support for this donation drive.

3. The General Body Meeting of the Church was held after the Holy Mass. The agenda included a review of key events in 2022 and a presentation of income and expenses overview.
