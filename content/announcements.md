If there is anyone, who hasn’t yet got a chance to sign up to be Patron/prasidhendhi for the Marian perunaal, there is still time until Aug 31st. The expected sponsorship per Patron is $100, but you can choose to donate as you will. The opportunity to sign up will close on Aug 31st.
All funds received through sponsorships and donations will cover expenses for the Marian Feast and the rest will go towards our Mission fund. Your generous donations make it possible for our community to come together and worship.
The Prayer jar is in the Narthex. You can write your intentions and prayers in the paper slips kept next to it and place in the jar. No need to write your name. Achan will take prayers and intentions, pray over them and lift them in Mass every Sunday till Sept 10. We highly encourage all children especially to write down your prayers and fill up the jar.
Sept 1st onwards we will begin praying the Novena. Thanks to all the families who have signed up to lead the prayers. The Novena will be prayed online on Zoom and the details will be shared in our main WhatsApp group. We invite all families to join in the conference call to pray together for all our intentions.
