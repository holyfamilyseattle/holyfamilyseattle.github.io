### Announcements from Sunday School

1. Holy Family Syro-Malabar Catholic Mission is excited to announce that registration is now open for Catechism classes for the year 2023-24. 

      Registration Details: All the children who participated in Catechism classes last year should be registered again for the upcoming school year. We encourage you to         register children ages 5 and above. Please register your child by  June 30th so that we have sufficient time to plan and organize the classes and place                     textbook orders.  

      <b><a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/yACwh84g6i22LJWYA">Register here</a></b>. Please reach out to catechism@hfsmc.org if you have any questions.
