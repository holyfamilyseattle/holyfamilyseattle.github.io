### Announcement from Altar Guild and Liturgical Ministries

1. As of today there are more than 30 families signed up to be patrons for the upcoming Marian Feast on Sept 10th. We thank you for your generosity. Each Patron family will be included in the Novena starting Sept 1 and we will be praying for all their personal intentions in the Rosary. 
There is still time for those who would still like to sign up. You can find the flyer and sign up sheet in the Narthex. We are inviting $100, from each patron/family to meet the expenses of the feast day. You can make this payment online or pay directly via cheque or cash to the trustees mentioning the Marian feast.
