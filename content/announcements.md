Among those who have already signed up, if you haven’t made your promised contribution, kindly do so soon. All payments can be made online through our Mission’s Website, or given as cheque or cash to one of the trustees, mentioning the Marian feast. 
As we began last week, you will find the  Prayer jar in the Narthex. You can write your intentions and prayers in the paper slips kept next to it and place in the jar. No need to write your name. Achan will take prayers and intentions, pray over them and lift them in Mass every Sunday till Sept 10. We highly encourage all children especially to write down your prayers and fill up the jar.
