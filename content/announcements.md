1. As announced earlier, we will have in-person classes downstairs in the middle level next Sunday at 4:10pm for 4th to 12th grade classes. The rest of the students will have online class in the morning at 9am. Parents, please bring your children between 4-4:10pm so that we can start on time. Once you drop off your child, please wait outside or in the sanctuary. The teachers will bring the students back to the sanctuary at 4:55pm.

2. We are partnering with the outreach ministry to collect food and non food items to donate to Tent City 4 which is a homeless encampment in Sammamish. We encourage you individually or as a small group or as a class to consider preparing a hot dinner for the residents. Please contact Anna Mathew or Betty Chempananical for more details on preparing and dropping off the dinner. Non food items can be dropped off between Jan 22nd-Feb 19th on Sundays at church or during the week at 3 drop off locations at Bellevue, Bothell and Issaquah. The list of most wanted items and drop off locations is posted on our whatsapp group and FB page. We request your wholehearted support for this donation drive.
Sunday school students, when you drop off items, please write your grade with a marker on the item example 1A, 3B etc. Grade 10 students will track which class collects the most  items and they have planned a surprise for that class. All other donations do not need to be marked.

3. The next general body meeting is scheduled for January 29th, 2023 following holy mass. Attendance is mandatory. The agenda for the meeting includes reviewing significant events from 2022 and presenting an overview of income and expenses.

4. We have enabled provision for <a href="https://holyfamilyseattle.org/donation/" target="_blank">online donation</a>
