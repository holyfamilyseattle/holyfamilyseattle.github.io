### Announcement from Altar Guild and Liturgical Ministries

1. All ministries have met to begin planning the logistics for the upcoming Marian feast on Sept 10. There are a lot of items to put together, be it for the Qurbana, procession of the snehavirrunnu after. This being our first Perunnal that we are celebrating together as a Mission, let us also pray together as a community that all planning leading to the preparations of the Feast day will be guided by the Holy Spirit.
We sincerely thank the 35 families who have signed up to be Patrons for the Feast. Many of these patrons have already made their generous donations, while a few are yet to do so. We will be sending out reminders for these payments during the week via text messages.  Sign ups for Patrons will end on Aug 31st.
