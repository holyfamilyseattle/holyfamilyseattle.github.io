3. We are starting *Holy Childhood Association (Thirubalasakyam)* in our mission for children in KG to those who have not received Holy Communion. This is a stepping stone to becoming a Little Flower Mission League (LFML) member after they receive Holy Communion. This group will meet once a month after Holy Qurbana for group activities. Please register by Feb 28th. <a href="https://forms.gle/PX2ForHHvaP8AgdNA" target="_blank">Please register here</a>

We invite you to contribute individually or as a small group or class, preparing a hot dinner for the residents. For more information on how to prepare and drop off the dinner, please contact Anna Mathew (503-200-8516) or Betty Chempananical(347-679-9537). Non-food items can be dropped off between January 22nd and February 19th at the following locations:

Sunday school students, when you drop off items, please write your grade with a marker on the item (example: 1A, 3B, etc.). Grade 10 students will track which class collects the most items and have planned a surprise for that class. All other donations do not need to be marked.
