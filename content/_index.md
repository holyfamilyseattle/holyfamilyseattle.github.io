  text = "<img src=\"/img/pope-francis.jpg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <hr> It is with deep sorrow that we share the news of the passing of His Holiness, Pope Francis. <br> He was a shepherd to the world, a voice for peace, and a tireless advocate for the poor and marginalized. His humility, compassion, and unwavering faith have left an indelible mark on the Church and on humanity. <br> <br> As we mourn his loss, we ask our community to join together in prayer for the repose of his soul. May the Lord welcome him into eternal rest and grant comfort to the faithful around the world who grieve this loss. <br><br> Let us also pray for the Church in this time of transition, that the Holy Spirit may guide and strengthen us all. <hr> <h3>Weekly Mass Schedule</h3> We meet every Sunday 5 PM and Saturday 9 AM at [3730 148th Ave SE, Bellevue, WA 98006](https://goo.gl/maps/b7gUDngzcUodwTtS6). <hr> "
