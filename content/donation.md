title: "Online Donation"
---

Our Church has an online giving account through <a target="_blank" href="https://get.tithe.ly/">Tithe.ly</a>.  You can download their app from Apple's or Google's App stores.

We also include a link to Tithe.ly here so you can donate to us through them.  

They will issue a year-end giving statement for all your online donations. We won't need to issue a statement for gifts given through them.  

Just click the button, the rest should be self-explanatory.
